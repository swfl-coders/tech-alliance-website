# Tech Alliance of SWFL

This repository is for the website of our newly created Tech Alliance with all our sister groups in SWFL.
## 🚀 Getting Started

1. [Follow this great guide](https://gist.github.com/Chaser324/ce0505fbed06b947d962), but keep in mind we are using `main` instead of `master` for our default branch.

  FORK this repo first!
   On terminal:
   For SSH
   `git@github.com:swfl-coders/tech-alliance-website.git`

   For HTTP (Recommended)
   `https://github.com/swfl-coders/tech-alliance-website.git`

## 🤓 Run the app

IMPORTANT: We are using node v20

1. Install dependencies `npm install`

2. Run the app `npm run dev`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## 📜 Testing the app

We use Vite as our testing framework. To write and run test scripts:

1. Add files under the `__tests__` folder, organized into folders named after the unit or module being tested

2. Name the file `<identifier>.test.js`, or `<identifier>.test.jsx` if you are rendering components in the react extention notation

3. Run the tests with `npm run test`

View your console to see the results.

You can edit the test scripts and the application code in real-time. Vite reruns the tests as you edit the test scripts or application code.
